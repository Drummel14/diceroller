# diceroller
a simple diceroller app made in C++ in an hour or two (I really just needed something to put here when I made the github :P)

It will ask for input if none is provided directly via the command line.

Syntax for command line is as follows

./diceRoller (number of dice)d(type of dice)

Ex. ./diceRoller 3d4  #will roll three 4-sided dice.
    ./diceRoller 34d8 #will roll thirty-four 8-sided dice.
